# JPMC-Tech-Experience-
This repository contains my solutions to the tasks in the JPMorgan-Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience from InsiderSherpa

I am currently working through the experience in my free time because it piqued my interest in financial markets and will help me brush up on my Python skills. I have been working in Python 3.8 

The patch file shows the additions and subtractions for each solution, and the accompanying files are finished files. 

The job involves setting up functionality for equity trader dashboards that allows them to track correlated stocks for their trading strategies 

Task One: Interface with a stock price data feed 

  Fix the broken Python system to obtain quotes for two individual stocks including their Bid, Ask and Market Prices every "N" seconds
  
  Fix the system to obtain the Ratio between the two stocks
  
Task Two: Use JPMorgan Frameworks and Tools 

  In progress
